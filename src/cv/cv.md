## 🙋🏻‍♂️Brief introduction

> Hi, I'm a front-end developer who can code all day without getting tired.

Hi everyone, my journey into web programming was by accident, I started it with a part-time job designing non-coding landing pages.

At that time I had some complicated problems. I had to get help from a brother of mine, he wrote me a piece of code and I solved the problem. At that time, I had many questions in my mind. And that journey has stuck with me for a year.

I was very lucky that just getting started, I had the opportunity to participate in a real website-building project at my previous company. I was touched and it gave me a lot of experience from coding to presentation skills, thinking of a developer. These things help me confidently can apply for the position at your company.
