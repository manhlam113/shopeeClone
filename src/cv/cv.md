## 🙋🏻‍♂️Brief introduction

> 🎖 Hi, I'm a front-end developer who can code all day without getting tired. I have a big dream working in silicon valley. I know it's very unlikely right now, but keep dreaming, because no one is taxing your dreams.

> 🏅 I like the most quote: "The number of years of work does not fully reflect a person's experience, I can work equivalent to people with 1-2 years of experience, otherwise you do not need to pay me"

Hi everyone, my journey into web programming was by accident, I started it with a part-time job designing non-coding landing pages.

At that time I had some complicated problems. I had to get help from a brother of mine, he wrote me a piece of code and I solved the problem. At that time, I had many questions in my mind. And that journey has stuck with me for a year.

I was very lucky that just getting started, I had the opportunity to participate in a real website-building project at my previous company. I was touched and it gave me a lot of experience from coding to presentation skills, thinking of a developer. These things help me confidently can apply for the position at your company.
